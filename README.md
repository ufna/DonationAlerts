# DonationAlerts UE4

DonationAlerts integration plugin for Unreal Engine 4.

This plugin allows stream viewers to make changes to the gameplay on the go: switch weapons, alter character behavior or environmental factors. Itâ€™s up to the developer to choose the elements that can be made interactive. DonationAlerts will be providing developers with all the necessary information: donation value, message text, sender name, currency, date and time of donation. With this data at hand, the game could choose one of the scenarios to run.
